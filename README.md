Angular Pomodoro-like task app.

### Simple pomodoro app in js ###
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)

Basically its a todo app thatâ€™s tied to a timer (all client side). Pomodoros are usually 25 minute intervals but for this demo they are varying durations in seconds. 

**The app features:**
- input form for creating a new task
- task list
- expired task list
- an alert when the task time as completed
- a start/stop button for the timer
- angular `controller as` syntax
- Bootstrap-css styles
- Karma/Jasmine unit tests for the controllers (cd into directory and run `npm test`)
- the ability to load sample tasks

times-ticking angular part deux
===============================

Christopher Lepore

Updated Angular Pomodoro-like app.

### Simple pomodoro app in js ###
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)

Basically a todo app thatâ€™s tied to a timer (all on the client side). Pomodoros are usually 25 minutes intervals but for this demo make them 25 seconds. 

**The app will need:**
- input form (task name)
- task list (name and time remaining)
- some kind of alert when the task time as completed, with a button to start the timer for the next task.

**Bonus points:**
- rename/remove/reorder tasks
- slick/creative GUI
